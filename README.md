## What It Does

Session Deck gives you a browser-based dashboard for your tmux sessions. Each pane is a live terminal connected to a real tmux session — you can type, run commands, and see output in real time. Organize panes into workspaces with drag-and-drop layouts.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** on the host machine
- **tmux** installed on at least one host
- **SSH access** to any remote hosts you want to manage (key-based auth recommended)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jesseprojects/session-deck.git
cd session-deck
npm install
npm run build
```

### Run

```bash
# Start the server (default: port 7890)
npm start

# Or with custom port
SESSION_DECK_PORT=3000 npm start
```

Open `http://<your-host>:7890` in a browser. On first launch, the setup wizard walks you through:

1. **Import hosts** from your `~/.ssh/config` (or add them manually)
2. **Test connectivity** — verify SSH access and tmux availability
3. **Create your first workspace** with a layout preset

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start backend with auto-reload + Vite dev server with HMR
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on `:7890`, frontend dev server on `:5173` with API proxy.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SESSION_DECK_PORT` | `7890` | Server port |
| `SESSION_DECK_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `SESSION_DECK_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level (fatal/error/warn/info/debug/trace) |
| `SESSION_DECK_DB_PATH` | `./data/session-deck.db` | SQLite database path |
| `SESSION_DECK_AUTH_USER` | — | Optional first-run admin username |
| `SESSION_DECK_AUTH_PASS` | — | Optional first-run admin password |
| `SESSION_DECK_SESSION_SECRET` | Auto-generated in `data/session-secret` | Session cookie secret; set explicitly for managed production deployments |
| `SESSION_DECK_SESSION_MAX_AGE` | `86400` | Session cookie max age in seconds |

### Authentication

Session Deck uses local account/password authentication by default.

On first launch, if no account exists, the browser opens a setup page where you create the first administrator account.
For unattended deployments, set the initial account through environment variables:

```bash
SESSION_DECK_AUTH_USER=admin
SESSION_DECK_AUTH_PASS=your-secure-password
SESSION_DECK_SESSION_SECRET=random-32-char-string
```

If `SESSION_DECK_SESSION_SECRET` is omitted, Session Deck generates a random persistent secret in the data directory. Keep `data/session-secret` private and backed up with the database; changing it signs out existing browser sessions.

### Security Notes

- Session Deck can execute commands inside configured tmux hosts by design. Only expose it on trusted networks or behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS.
- Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` enables Docker container support, but it effectively grants control over the host Docker daemon to authenticated Session Deck users.
- Managed SSH private keys are stored under the data directory with `0600` permissions. Keep the `data/` directory private and out of source control.
- The app has no anonymous mode: first launch requires account setup, and all API/WebSocket routes require authentication after setup.

### Run as a systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/session-deck.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Session Deck — Web-Based tmux Workspace Manager
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-user
Group=your-user
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/session-deck
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node src/index.js
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
SyslogIdentifier=session-deck

Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Environment=SESSION_DECK_PORT=7890
Environment=SESSION_DECK_LOG_LEVEL=info
Environment=LANG=C.UTF-8
Environment=LC_ALL=C.UTF-8

# Security — must NOT use PrivateTmp (tmux socket lives in /tmp)
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now session-deck
```

> ⚠️ **Do not enable `PrivateTmp=true`** — it isolates `/tmp`, making the tmux socket invisible to the service. `ProtectSystem` and `ProtectHome` also interfere with SSH access to remote hosts.

### SSH Setup for Remote Hosts

Session Deck connects to remote hosts via SSH to manage tmux sessions. For each remote host:

1. **Generate an SSH key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "session-deck"
   ```

2. **Copy the key to the remote host:**
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@remote-host
   ```

3. **Verify passwordless access:**
   ```bash
   ssh user@remote-host "echo ok"
   ```

4. **Add to Session Deck** via Settings → Servers → Add Host (or import from SSH config).

Session Deck reads `~/.ssh/config` for the user running the service. Hosts defined there can be imported with one click.

### Installing tmux on Remote Hosts

When you test a host's connectivity, Session Deck detects whether tmux is installed. If it's missing, it shows the correct install command for the host's OS:

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install -y tmux` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install -y tmux` |
| CentOS/RHEL | `sudo yum install -y tmux` |
| Alpine | `sudo apk add tmux` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S tmux` |
| macOS | `brew install tmux` |

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`9` | Switch workspace |
| `N` | New workspace |
| `I` | Toggle properties panel |
| `Shift+1`–`9` | Focus pane by index |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Zoom / unzoom pane |
| `Esc` | Unzoom / close menu |

### Mouse Actions

- **Click** a pane to focus it
- **Right-click** a pane header for context menu (change session, split, close, zoom)
- **Right-click** a workspace tab for context menu (rename, duplicate, delete)
- **Drag** a pane header to another pane to swap or split
- **Drag** the border between panes to resize

### Copy/Paste

Select text with the mouse in any terminal pane, then:
- `Ctrl+C` — copy selection (when text is selected and no process captures it)
- `Ctrl+V` — paste from clipboard
- Right-click also provides copy/paste options

### Activity Notifications

When a tmux session produces output in a workspace you're not currently viewing, that workspace tab shows a pulsing orange dot. Switch to the workspace to clear the badge.

Session Deck polls tmux `session_activity` timestamps every 10 seconds using a lightweight API endpoint (`/api/activity`) that skips type and context detection — typically completes in under 50ms for local sessions.

### Install as Standalone App

Session Deck is a PWA — you can install it as a standalone app from Edge or Chrome:

1. Open Session Deck in your browser
2. Click the install icon in the address bar (or **⋮ → Install Session Deck**)
3. Right-click the taskbar icon → **Pin to taskbar**

The app runs in its own window with no browser chrome, has its own Alt+Tab entry, and shows the Session Deck icon in the taskbar.

### Settings Menu
